# Overview

Image-based Structural Analysis (ISA) is an application of studying the behavior of structural system from image domain using modern deep machine learning methods. The project was initiated by Cheng Ning Loong, a PhD student from HKUST, under the supervision of Prof. Chih-Chen Chang. This application includes three main parts: (i) segmentation; (ii) classification; and (iii) system reconstruction. The following are the contributors who involve in developing the application:
1. Ng Zhi Yong Ignavier
2. Justin San Juan
3. Bernadino Realino
4. Yong Xin Lai
5. Pishun Tantivangphaisal
6. Jimmy Leung Whing Cheong Tom
7. Lai Sheung Wan.
